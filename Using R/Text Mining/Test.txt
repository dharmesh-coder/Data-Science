A manager is a person who is responsible for a part of a company, i.e., they 'manage' the company.
Managers may be in charge of a department and the people who work in it. 
In some cases, the manager is in charge of the whole business. 
For example, a ‘restaurant manager’ is in charge of the whole restaurant.
A manager is a person who exercises managerial functions primarily. 
They should have the power to hire, fire, discipline, do performance appraisals, and monitor attendance.
They should also have the power to approve overtime, and authorize vacations. 
He or she is the boss.


Top Managers are in charge of a company’s strategy. 
In other words, they are the stewards of an organization’s vision and mission.
Functional Managers are responsible for the effectiveness and efficiency of specific areas of a company, such as marketing.
They are also in charge of personnel and accounts.
Team Managers or Supervisory Managers are in charge of subgroups of a particular function. 
They may also be in charge of a group of members from different parts of the company.
Line Managers are in charge of the output of certain products or services. 
They hold authority in a vertical chain of command, or over a particular product line.

Product Managers in for example technology companies are typically the CEO of a product. 
They are also responsible for its strategy, roadmap, and everything regarding its production. 
Storage and sales are also the General Manager’s responsibility.

The position usually includes marketing, forecasting, and profit and loss responsibilities.

Brand Managers focus on the perception and maintenance of a particular brand. 
They are different from Product Managers.

The Brand Manager’s job is often strategic, involving high-level curation of both the firm’s image and the practical steps to maintain that image.

The Brand Manager aims to enhance, maintain, and encourage interest in the brand. 
There is a strong emphasis on marketing and the company’s overall image. 
Brand managers inspire feeling, reactions, and loyalty.

Brand management is common in consumer product companies. 
Product management, on the other hand, is common in software firms.

This is because consumer product businesses need a top-of-the-mind recall of their products and brands because they mass market them.





A company is a legal entity formed by a group of individuals to engage in and operate a business—commercial or industrial—enterprise. 
A company may be organized in various ways for tax and financial liability purposes depending on the corporate law of its jurisdiction.


The line of business the company is in will generally determine which business structure it chooses such as a partnership, proprietorship, or corporation. 
These structures also denote the ownership structure of the company.


They can also be distinguished between private and public companies. 
Both have different ownership structures, regulations, and financial reporting requirements.



A company is essentially an artificial person—also known as corporate personhood—in that it is an entity separate from the individuals who own, manage, and support its operations. 
Companies are generally organized to earn a profit from business activities, though some may be structured as nonprofit charities. 
Each country has its own hierarchy of company and corporate structures, though with many similarities.

A company has many of the same legal rights and responsibilities as a person does, like the ability to enter into contracts, the right to sue (or be sued), borrow money, pay taxes, own assets, and hire employees.

The benefits of starting a company include income diversification, a strong correlation between effort and reward, creative freedom and flexibility. 
The disadvantages of starting a company include increased financial responsibility, increased legal liability, long hours, responsibility for employees and administrative staff, regulations, and tax issues. 
Many of the world's largest personal fortunes have been amassed by people who have started their own company.

Companies can be divided into two distinct categories for both legal and regulatory purposes: Public and private companies.

A public or publicly-traded company allows shareholders to be equity owners when they purchase shares through a stock exchange. 
Someone who owns a large number of shares has a larger stake in the company compared to someone who has a small number of shares. 
Shares are first issued through an initial public offering (IPO) before trading begins on a secondary exchange. 
Apple, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Netflix are all examples of public companies.

Public companies are held to strict reporting and regulatory requirements by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Under these guidelines, companies must file financial statements and reports annually outlining the financial health of the company. 
This prevents fraudulent reports and activities.


Assistants help both their superiors and their businesses run more smoothly. They often manage an office as well as the professional life of their supervisor. This includes tasks such as answering phones and scheduling meetings. Learn more about what an assistant is, different types of assistants, their skills and see some frequently asked questions.
An assistant is an individual who helps a higher-ranking senior. They help in any particular work such as gathering supplies, making phone calls and any other menial task that aids the senior individual with their own work. Personal assistants in business settings often schedule meetings, handle correspondence and take notes of important information. Those who work for a specific person rather than a business entity might also do personal chores such as dry-cleaning, vacation scheduling, house sitting and more.
Make to-do lists at the beginning of each day. As an assistant, you’re likely to have a long list of objectives. Keeping track of them with a list makes you more efficient and effective at your job.
Due to the large number of tasks you may have on a given day, prioritize them, completing the most pressing tasks first. This ensures your most important objectives are completed each day regardless of finishing your full to-do list.
If your superior has multiple appointments within a single day, schedule them back-to-back if you’re able. This prioritizes your superior’s day more efficiently. Staggering meetings and appointments throughout their day breaks up their available work time, often as a drawback.
On occasions in which you are not available during normal business hours, use the out-of-office feature in your email. This sends an automated, personalized message to senders explaining that you’re not in the office. Within your message, announce the dates in which you’re out and that you plan to answer their message as soon as you can.


Generally, it’s advised that you use whatever means necessary to keep up with the discussion around you. 
However, this may not be viable if your superior prefers to see your notes after you take them. 
Double check with your workplace before using shorthand or other methods of quick note-taking.
